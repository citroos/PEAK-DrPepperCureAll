# Dr Pepper Cure All

A mod that replaces the Cure-All with a refreshing can of Dr Pepper. Just take a sip and let the healing energy of those 23 flavors flow through you.

## PLEASE NOTE:

This is a client-side mod, meaning everyone must have the mod installed in order to see the Dr Pepper.

## Configuration

Since this is a can, it does not shatter when thrown like the regular Cure-All, so the config lets you turn the shatter back on if you want. It kinda just disappears on shatter so I don't really recommend it, but hey, it's your game.

After running the mod at least once, configuration can be found at:<br>[steam directory]\PEAK\BepInEx\config\DrPepperCureAll.cfg
(or in your mod manager's BepInEx directory)

## Manual Installation

1. Download the latest version of [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
2. Extract the zip into your game directory, which should be at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PEAK
3. Start the game once for first-time BepInEx setup
4. Place this mod's folder (containing DrPepperCureAll.dll) into the BepInEx\plugins directory
5. Done!
